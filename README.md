Please to get know how to use it look at the integration tests under:
 - src\itest\java\com\github\renf7\nbpcases\controller

If you want to execute with integration test please consider running maven with profile integration-tests . Be careful because integration-tests requires a connection to NBP services. Basically under links like: http://api.nbp.pl/api/exchangerates/rates/c/USD/2022-09-09/
